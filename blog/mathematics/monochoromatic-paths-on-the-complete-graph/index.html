    I found a question on the Mathematics Stack Exchange page [1] with
the following problem statement.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     All edges of a complete graph are colored: each edge with a red or
blue color. Show that there exists a color such that every two vertices
can be connected by a path with edges of this color of length at most
3.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    I attempted the question and my proof was different to the accepted
answer.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Theorem
   </h1>
   <p>
    All edges of a complete graph are colored: each edge with a red or
blue color. Show that there exists a color such that every two vertices
can be connected by a path with edges of this color of length at most
3.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Proof
   </h1>
   <p>
    The colourings of the edges define two subgraphs that are
complements, so at least one of these subgraphs is connected. In the
case where only one of the colours define a connected subgraph then
choose this colour and look at the complement of the graph that this
colouring defines. If two vertices are in separate connected components
in the complement graph then these two vertices are connected by a path
of length one in the original graph indicating that there is an edge
between these two vertices of the chosen colour. If these vertices, (u,
v), are otherwise in the same connected component in the complement
graph then as the complement graph is disconnected, there is a vertex,
(w), in a different connected component and there is no edge between
either of these vertices to (w) in the complement so there are thus
edges (uw) and (wv) in the subgraph defined by this colour so there is a
path of this colour of length less than 3, namely (uwv). In both cases,
we have constructed a path of length three or less so we are done.
   </p>
   <p>
    If both of these subgraphs are connected then select an arbitrary
color. If this colour connects every two vertices with a path of length
at most three then we are done. If, however, this is not the case then I
will show that the other colour joins all vertices with paths of length
at most 3.
